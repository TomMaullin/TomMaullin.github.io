\section{About}

At present, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Big Data Institute, University of Oxford. My research interests include distributed machine learning, spatial statistics, linear mixed models, and random field theory. Most recently, I have worked on establishing probabilistic bounds for random excursion sets and introducing novel derivations for mixed model parameter estimation.

\section{Research Overview}

\underline{Linear Mixed Models:} The analysis of longitudinal, heterogeneous or unbalanced clustered data is central to neuroimaging analysis. Such analyses are typically conducted using the Linear Mixed Model (LMM) but, over time, the breadth of models considered to fall under the umbrella term `LMM' has expanded to include more complex, multi-factored designs. In my research on this topic, I extend classic methods for LMM parameter estimation and inference to encompass the modern-day definition. Applications include large-scale computation, privacy-protected algorithms, and a clinical study investigating the link between alcohol consumption and brain function ([\href{https://doi.org/10.1007/s11222-021-10026-6}{1},\href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119729}{2},\href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2022.103066}{3},\href{https://doi.org/10.1007/s12021-024-09657-7}{4}]).

\underline{Random Field Theory:} A random field is a continuously differentiable function which varies over space, like the surface of the ocean or heat in a weather map. Random fields are central to a range of applications such as climatology, neuroscience and cosmology. In forthcoming work in this area, in the context of simple signal plus noise models, we derive minimal regularity conditions under which estimated topological features of random fields (such as Morse points and Betti numbers) resemble those of truth, and provide novel central limit theorems for the size of random clusters.

\underline{Confidence Regions:} Researchers often are interested in questions of the form ``At which locations does a signal, $\mu$, exceed a certain value $c$?". For example, ``Where did large temperature changes occur in a geospatial heatmap?" or ``Where do changes in blood flow in the brain suggest cognition?". Such questions translate formally into the study of excursion sets, sets of the form $\mathcal{A}_c:=\{s:\mu(s)\geq c\}$ (Fig. \ref{fig:fMRI}). Confidence Regions (CRs) illustrate the variability in estimating such regions, providing bounds on their shape and size. Presently, I am involved in a range of CR-themed projects including; (i) generating CRs for piece-wise continuous processes, (ii) using CRs to assist presurgical planning and (iii) deriving `cluster-specific' CR coverage statements. In previous work, I derived novel CR methodology for bounding intersections and unions of excursion sets ([\href{https://doi.org/10.1093/jrsssb/qkad104}{5}]).

     2018 - 2022: & \textbf{Doctoral Degree, University of Oxford:} \\
     & \\
     & My doctoral research pursued two distinct avenues of neuroimaging methods development. The first avenue focused on the derivation of novel expressions for estimation and inference of the Linear Mixed Model (LMM). These expressions were employed to perform computationally efficient large-scale fMRI LMM analyses. The second research direction centred on extending an existing theory of confidence regions to provide bounds for the intersection, or ‘conjunction’, of excursion sets that have been acquired across the same spatial region but under different study conditions. Such `conjunctions' are of natural interest in image analysis as they correspond to the question ``Where was brain activation observed in the same place across multiple study conditions?''.\\
     & \\
     2014 - 2017: & \textbf{Undergraduate Degree, University of Warwick:}\\
     & \\
     & I hold a 2:1 in BSc Data Science (Hons) from the University of Warwick. This course was comprised of modules from the Computer Science, Mathematics and Statistics programs, respectively. Through my courses, I developed a broad range of skills relevant to statistics and computing, including the ability to efficiently program in Java, R and SQL, as well as logical deduction, proof methods and the understanding and application of several widely-used statistical models.\\
